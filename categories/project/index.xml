&lt;p&gt;Shinkai (深海) is a multiplayer mod for
the game &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/Subnautica/&#34;&gt;Subnautica&lt;/a&gt;.
It is open source and available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nkga/shinkai&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mod was tested on the March update of the game (Update 84), but it seems to work
with the April build as well. I have personally verified that the game was playable
from beginning to completion with 3 friends online, but there isn&amp;rsquo;t any explicit limit.
As far as a feature list goes, most of the single player experience carries over
to multiplayer the way you would expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes on development of the mod and its challenges follow below.

      <title>Video Playback for Games with VP9</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When working on porting an older PC game to a modern version of Windows I
needed play its prerecorded videos in-game. Commercial engines (Unity, UE4)
include this functionality, and there are also standalone solutions
&lt;a href=&#34;www.radgametools.com/bink&#34;&gt;Bink&lt;/a&gt; that can work for a custom engine. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t
interested in licensing a commercial product, so I developed my own video player.
