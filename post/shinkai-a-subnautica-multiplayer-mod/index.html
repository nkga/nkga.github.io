<p>Shinkai (深海) is a multiplayer mod for
the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/Subnautica/">Subnautica</a>.
It is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/nkga/shinkai">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The mod was tested on the March update of the game (Update 84), but it seems to work
with the April build too. I have personally verified that the game was playable
from beginning to completion with 3 friends online, but there isn&rsquo;t any forced limit.
As far as a feature list goes, most of the single player experience carries over
to multiplayer the way you would expect it to.</p>

<p>Notes on development of the mod and its challenges follow below.
</p>

<h3 id="mod-history-nitrox">Mod History: Nitrox</h3>

<p>Before developing Shinkai, I looked into existing efforts to make the game multiplayer.
The only organized attempt I could find was <a href="https://github.com/SubnauticaNitrox/Nitrox">Nitrox</a>.
However, it no longer seems to be in active development and was missing many core features that I felt were required for a fun co-op
experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>No support for loading or saving progress</li>
<li>Base building was non functional, no piece/room rotation support</li>
<li>Base building was only synced for players that were currently connected to the server</li>
<li>Most bases pieces (reactors, growbeds, etc) were non functional</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t see equipment on other players</li>
<li>Player and vehicle positions desynchronize, no Cyclops submarine support</li>
<li>Poor latency in real networking conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>I have addressed all of these issues with the development of Shinkai.</p>

<h3 id="diving-in">Diving In</h3>

<p>Subnautica is a game developed in <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, so it&rsquo;s trivial
to reverse engineer. You can use tools like <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy">ILSpy</a>
to dump the full source code for the game contained in its <code>Assembly-CSharp-*</code> files.
To get the game loading the mod, I use <a href="https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy">DNSpy</a> to
patch the C# IL on a function that gets called at game startup. This patch calls into
the Shinkai assembly and its initialization functions.</p>

<p>Although you can write entire mods by modifying the original assemblies directly with DNSpy,
 it&rsquo;s not really manageable when you have to apply a lot of patches. Most Unity game modders
 make use of <a href="https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony">Harmony</a> &ndash; a library for modifying the C#
 IL dynamically at runtime. It&rsquo;s what I use for Shinkai and its ~50 patches.</p>

<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/udp_vs_tcp/">UDP</a> for any real-time game networking.
Unreliable packets are a great bandwidth and performance optimization for anything sent
on an interval (like physics). Everything else &ndash; connection negotiation, gameplay actions,
entity spawning, state changes and chat &ndash; require an additional TCP-like reliability layer
on top of UDP to ensure their packets are delivered and in-order.</p>

<p>I tried out <a href="https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib">LiteNetLib</a> for the
reliability layer for Shinkai since I didn&rsquo;t want to spend the time
developing something <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/reliability_ordering_and_congestion_avoidance_over_udp/">custom</a>
for a C# project.
It picked it mostly because its API, but it also seemed to perform well on
<a href="https://github.com/nxrighthere/BenchmarkNet/wiki/Benchmark-Results">benchmarks</a> for performance.
This is something I would probably reevaluate if I went back to the project, however.
It took modification of the default MTU rates and queue sizes to get something
that work reliably under real world conditions, and I&rsquo;m still not
content with how clients can&rsquo;t &ldquo;reconnect&rdquo; without recreating the socket and
changing their local connection port.</p>

<h3 id="saving-and-loading">Saving and Loading</h3>

<p>Subnautica save files serialize game entities (bases, vehicles, the player)
and the map (voxel data, loot spawns). Game entities are fast to synchronize,
since that data is only a few kilobytes in size. The map data weighs in at
multiple megabytes, and because the generator state isn&rsquo;t deterministic it
means that future spawns won&rsquo;t be synchronized. I opted to have the server
be in control of a custom save format.</p>

<p>I first modded the loot and entity spawners in the game to be deterministic based on a
server seed, to save having to synchronize megabytes when a client connects. Since
players can encounter chunks in any order, I mix the server seed with the position
data for the spawn location on the map. The loot remains fairly random, and
players can share locations of loot and research unlocks with each other since the map
is the same. However, I don&rsquo;t synchronize gathering of the resources between clients.
The world&rsquo;s resources are finite and fairly scarce &ndash; with many players you&rsquo;d quickly
run out of loot.</p>

<p>For game entities like bases and vehicles, I store their relevant information
on the server and &ldquo;replay&rdquo; the messages back to clients that are joining. This
works well in practice and saved a lot of development time, but it&rsquo;s a fairly
inefficient method of handling the problem. If I were to refactor the project,
I would work on trying to share/update something similar to the game&rsquo;s
&ldquo;root&rdquo; object tree for this kind of data.</p>

<p>I treat most game progression (unlocked research, data logs, equipment) as
individual progression. Player data is synchronized and saved on the server
as you would expect.</p>

<h3 id="base-building">Base Building</h3>

<p><img src="../../img/subnautica_building.jpg" alt="Base Building" /></p>

<p>This was the hardest to get working right between the clients. In hindsight,
all of the problems associated with synchronizing base building could have been
solved by doing a full serialize/sync with the associated base after any
construction event, even if this is inefficient bandwidth-wise.</p>

<p>The way the building currently works is loosely based on existing work by
the Nitrox team &ndash; when a player builds or modifies a base piece, it is
simulated across all clients.</p>

<p>The first problem was handling piece rotation. To have the pieces rotated the
same across on each client, each rotatable piece needed a unique patch to
Subnautica&rsquo;s code. If the game adds any new types of pieces in the future,
more work be required to support them.</p>

<p>The second problem was dealing with synchronization. When deconstructing
a base piece, a new object is typically spawned in its place. Knowing which
object is replaced is tricky, and the server doesn&rsquo;t have knowledge of the
base structure itself &ndash; which means any modification must be stored
on the server, even if the base piece gets removed later.</p>

<p>Since any number of events can be received in a single frame, problems arise with
base pieces getting blocked by pieces that would be considered gone on the next frame
after Unity has processed the destruction event. This typically only happened with
window / reinforcement pieces, and required patches to resolve the bug.</p>

<p>With these problems fixed, implementing missing functionality for synchronized
base pieces is fairly trivial. Most of the functional base pieces are glorified
item containers and simply requiring maintaining a shared GUID across all clients
that was generated during placement.</p>

<h3 id="vehicles">Vehicles</h3>

<p><img src="../../img/subnautica_cyclops.jpg" alt="Cyclops" /></p>

<p>All vehicles have synchronized upgrades, inventories and health. The Prawn Suit
was one of the vehicles I had the most fun with in the main game, so I put extra
work into making sure all of its animations and events work the same as in
single player. Attacking with the arms, grappling, drilling and the walking
animations are all fully functional and synced between clients.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/subnautica_docking.jpg" alt="Docking" /></p>

<p>The Cyclops submarine is a fairly complex and large mobile base in Subnautica.
I&rsquo;ve implemented most of the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; functionality for it &ndash; lights, horns,
engine state, docking, building all worked mostly as you&rsquo;d expect. Synchronized
leaks and fires are something that I would have liked to add, but never got around
to.</p>

<h3 id="physics-synchronization">Physics Synchronization</h3>

<p>In Nitrox, most objects continuously interpolated towards their real position but
would never attain the actual value.
Vehicles were also mishandled by relying on PhysX to be deterministic
(it&rsquo;s not) with velocity simulation &ndash; in my tests, vehicle position
would drift by many meters over time.</p>

<p>In Shinkai, players and controlled vehicles are interpolated towards
their last received position from the server at a dynamic rate. The rate is
determined by the calculated packet update frequency and latency. To keep
things smooth if packets are dropped or late, limited extrapolation is allowed
when the interpolation deadline expires.</p>

<p>Players can push around items and unmanned vehicles in Subnautica, so I wanted
to synchronize those too. Since these are typically slow moving, I
rely on the client&rsquo;s physics simulation to keep them in roughly the same
place. Whenever they stray too far away from their last updated position,
the player notifies the server of the new location. While saving bandwidth
with nice, this also lets any client interact and push these
objects - everyone is considered the host when it comes to shared physics
experiences like this.</p>

<h3 id="release-and-future-support">Release and Future Support</h3>

<p>Having played through the game multiple times alone and with friends, I
think it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye to the world of Subnautica. The public
release of Shinkai is not a fully engineered product, but a collection of
ideas and concepts I tried when creating a playable experience for a close
group of friends over a few weeks of programming in my free time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m open to community contributions to the project, but I think they would be
better forward towards the development of Nitrox &ndash; the project that sparked
my interest in developing Shinkai.</p>
